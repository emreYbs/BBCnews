In terminal, the script will work well but in the end, you will get an error due to the Pandas Data Frame part in the code. So you delete that part if you use to use in the terminal only. For me, a Pandas Data Frame was needed, so I added that part.

**Requirements:**
- **BeautifulSoup**
- **cowsay**    *Not necessary for the scraping but I like cowsay:)*
- **Halo**      *For the cute animations, Halo is great.*
- **pandas** 

**Note:** This first version works well, but I plan to improve the code. For now, it is not as I wanted. You can edit as you wish or improve by contributing.
